# What i planned for user's to prove their ownership of the identifier

Registration of users is done using theie ETH Account and email address. So we can do add logic to do email verification. This will require adding one backend server which will be used to send the email to users and then can use this platform only if they verify their email. Same can be done whenever user's identifier validation is required.
